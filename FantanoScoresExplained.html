    <h1>Fantano Scores Explained</h1>

    <img src="images/SCSU_18_AnthonyFantano-5055.jpg" alt="Anthony Fantano" style="width: 800; height: 500px;">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Anthony Fantano is a popular music critic known for his channel "theneedledrop". In which he regularly posts
        reviews on music albums. He has many fans due to his unbiased and honest opinions. One of the biggest debates of
        discussion on his channel is his 1-10 ratings at the end of his videos. So what do these 1-10 ratings really mean?
        You will find out in this article.</p>

    <h2>0. Abomination</h2>
    
    <p>This album is a soul-crushing experience. There's nothing even remotely good about it and there's no way to write it
        off. During the run of the album, the listener might try to come up with ways to give the artist the benefit of the
        doubt but the album will have successfully squared away any such doubts by the time it's over. Having not known that
        something like this was possible, the listener might even temporarily struggle to look at the world the way they did
        before listening. Fantano has only ever officially used this score once (although Corey Feldman's Angelic 2 the
        Core, to which Fantano didn't assign an official score, is possibly in this territory as well). <i> Note: These are the hits. Although he's never (to my knowledge) come straight out and said it, you can consider everything in this category to be effectively Fantano-recommended.</i></p>
    
    <h2>1. Barely Listenable</h2>
        
    <p>The artist has honed in on whatever made this album a hard listen in the first place and amplified it to the point
    where it's nearly become impossible to ignore. The result is an album that's effectively unlistenable. Nonetheless,
    there are at least one or two commendable (or at least reasonable) traits that the listener can choose to cling to
    if they want to maintain some semblance of faith in the artist for the duration of the listen.</p>
            
    <h2>2. Specially Bad</h2>

    <p>This is a rarer score that Fantano uses on an album that's awful in a special way. An album with this score can't
    just be too passive or too generic: the artist has to be actively doing something to make it worse. Maybe the sound
    quality is awful, maybe the tone is delusional; whatever it is, Fantano feels that the artist really shouldn't be
    getting away with this sort of thing.</p>

    <h2>3. Irritating</h2>

    <p>Not just a waste of time, this album has the genuine potential to negatively affect the listener's mood. The reason
        for this could be any number of things, but whether it's laziness, sloppiness, arrogance, poor taste, genericness,
        or any other negative trait, there's definitely something about this album that makes it a chore to listen to.</p>

    <h2>4. Forgettable</h2>
    
    <p>Lying at the crux between modest success and modest failure, this is an album that Fantano feels completely
        ambivalent about. You probably won't regret giving this album a shot but you also won't miss out on anything by
        skipping it. <i>Note: Fantano reserves these scores for albums that go beyond just being mere misses: albums in this category deserve legitimate credit for how bad they are</i></p>

        <h2>5. Tolerable</h2>
        
        <p>Maybe the potential is there and the artist isn't able to flesh it out, or maybe the effort is commendable but it
            just doesn't click. Either way, this project, while not worth going out of your way to avoid or anything, probably
            won't be worth your time</p>
        
        <h2>6. Adequate</h2>
        
        <p>This score is for the album that justifies its runtime but doesn't do a whole lot else. If you're sitting in a car or
            something with nothing better to do then you may as well try it out. That being said, you probably won't ever feel
            the need to come back to it and there are plenty of better projects out there.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Solid</h2>
        
        <p>This is a strong album that leaves a great impression. Its replayability may be hampered by technical shortcomings,
            track-to-track inconsistency or well-intentioned fanservice, but it's still definitely worth listening to at least
            once.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Excellent</h2>
        
        <p>This album, while not perfect, holds its own after several replays. Its flaws are typically fairly easy to catch
            under a microscope but its positives so overwhelmingly outweigh its negatives that its shortcomings become very easy
            for the listener to tune out. Fantano strongly recommends this album and believes it to be one of the genre's bests
            of the year.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Incredible</h2>
        
        <p>Fantano can't get enough of this album. This is an album that you'll never want to reach the end of; once you reach
            the end, your first reaction might be to immediately play all of it back again. Even the weakest tracks on this
            album aren't ever worth skipping. There might be as few as one or two minor gripes that keep Fantano from giving
            this album a perfect score; albums with this score typically find themselves in contention for Fantano's overall
            album of the year.</p>
        
        <h2>10. Transcendent</h2>
        
        <p>This is an incredibly rare score that Fantano uses to single out a potentially genre-defining album. Fantano protects
            this score to the point where an album with even a single technical flaw or lackluster moment is all but guaranteed
            not to recieve it. This ridiculous standard is a natural byproduct of the score's unobtainable design: the score is
            Fantano's clever alternative to breaking the scale and giving some sort of ridiculous made-up hyperbolic score when
            something truly special comes along. This score is the equivalent of Fantano throwing in the towel and admitting
            that there's nothing more he could have possibly wanted out of an album.</p>
